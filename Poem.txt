                { FAR FROM YOU.. }

          Far from you but still so close 
        you are the one whom my heart chose
        your eyes had shined when i proposed 
         sitting on my knees without a rose 
 
         And on those tuitions where we met 
      you gave me memories i can never forget
           now your absense gives me pain  
 but living with the memories , my heart is trained 
 
         And i hope we will meet soon again 
           so the moemories will regain...
